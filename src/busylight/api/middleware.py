"""FastAPI Middleware for Dynamic Device Management.

Implements middleware to handle USB device hot-plugging/unplugging events.
The light manager middleware runs before each API request to refresh the 
available light devices, ensuring the controller stays synchronized with
the current hardware state when devices are connected or disconnected
during runtime.
