class USBLight(abc.ABC):
    """A generic USB light that uses HIDAPI to control devices.

    This abstract base class attempts to support as many different
    lights as possible using the same interface. Light capabilities vary
    widely, but all lights support the following operations:

    - on with a color
    - off
    - blink off and on with a color

    Concrete implementations may expose more capabilities than required
    by USBLight, however it is up to the user to discover them.

    Concrete implementations of USBLight will provide:

    Abstract Properties
    - VENDOR_IDS : List[int]
    - PRODUCT_IDS : List[int]
    - vendor : str

    Abstract Methods
    - __bytes__
    - on
    - blink
    - reset

    In addition to providing USB infrastructre to subclasses, USBLight
    provides several classmethods:
    - supported_lights : list of subclasses
    - vendor_ids : list of integer vendor identifiers
    - first_light : returns the first available light
    - all_lights : returns all available lights

    The `first_light` and `all_lights` classmethods have different
    behaviors depending on the invoking class. If the methods are
    called by a subclass of USBLight, the method only returns lights
    supported by the subclass. If invoked via `USBlight`, returned
    available lights will be of all supported subclasses.
