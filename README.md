# `busylight`

Control USB attached LED lights like a Humanâ„¢

![Two Lights at Once](https://github.com/JnyJny/busylight/raw/master/demo/demo.gif)

Make a supported USB attached LED light turn on, off and blink; all
from the comfort of your very own command-line. If your platform
supports HIDAPI (Linux, MacOS, Windows and probably others), then
you can use `busylight`!

## Usage


```console
$ busylight on
$ busylight off
$ busylight on purple
$ busylight on 0xff00ff   # still purple.
$ busylight blink yellow  # all hands man your stations.
$ busylight blink red     # RED ALERT!
$ busylight off           # all clear.
```

## Supported Lights


```console
$ busylight supported
Embrava BlyncLight
Luxafor Flag
```

## Install


```console
$ pip install -U busylight-for-humans
$ busylight --help
```

$ busylight blink green    # now it's blinking green
$ busylight blink 0x00f    # now it's blinking blue
$ busylight blink #ffffff  # now it's blinking white
$ busylight --all blink    # now all available lights are blinking red
$ busylight --all off      # that's enough of that!

for all known USB lights by vendor id. Modify the rules to suit your
particular environment.

$ busylight udev-rules -o 99-busylight.rules
$ sudo cp 99-busylight.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
