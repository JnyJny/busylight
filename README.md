[BusyLight for Humansâ„¢][0] gives you control of USB attached LED
lights from a variety of vendors. Lights can be controlled via
the command-line, using a HTTP API or imported directly into your own
python project.

![All Supported Lights][DEMO]

**Eight Lights Attached to One Host**<br>
<em>Back to Front, Left to Right</em> <br>
<b>Busylight Alpha, Plantronics Status Indicator, BlyncLight, BlyncLight Plus</b><br>
<b>BlinkStick, Busylight Omega, Blink(1), Flag</b>

## Features
- Control lights from the [command-line][HELP].
- Control lights via a [Web API][WEBAPI].
- Import `busylight` into your own project.
- Supports six vendors & multiple models:
  * [**Agile Innovative** BlinkStick ][2]
  * [**Embrava** Blynclight][3]
  * [**Kuando** BusyLight][4]
  * [**Luxafor** Flag][5]
  * [**Plantronics** Status Indicator][3]
  * [**ThingM** Blink(1)][6]
- Supported on MacOS and Linux
- Windows support will be available in the near future.

If you have a USB light that's not on this list open an issue
with the make and model device you want supported, where I can get
one, and any public hardware documentation you are aware of.

### Gratitude

Thank you to [@todbot][todbot] and the very nice people at [ThingM][thingm] who
graciously and unexpectedly gifted me with two `blink(1) mk3` lights!

## Basic Install

Installs only the command-line `busylight` tool and associated
modules.

```console
$ python3 -m pip install busylight-for-humans 
```

## Web API Install

Installs `uvicorn` and `FastAPI` in addition to `busylight`:

```console
$ python3 -m pip install busylight-for-humans[webapi]
```

## Linux Post-Install Activities

Linux controls access to USB devices via the [udev subsystem][UDEV]. By
default it denies non-root users access to devices it doesn't
recognize. I've got you covered!

You'll need root access to configure the udev rules:

```console
$ busylight udev-rules -o 99-busylights.rules
$ sudo cp 99-busylights.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
$ sudo udevadm control -R
$ # unplug/plug your light
$ busylight on
```

## Command-Line Examples

```console
$ busylight on               # light turns on green
$ busylight on red           # now it's shining a friendly red
$ busylight on 0xff0000      # still red
$ busylight on #00ff00       # now it's blue!
$ busylight blink            # it's slowly blinking on and off with a red color
$ busylight blink green fast # blinking faster green and off
$ busylight --all on         # turn all lights on green
$ busylight --all off        # turn all lights off
```

## HTTP API Examples

First start the `busylight` API server:
```console
$ busylight serve
INFO:     Started server process [20189]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8888 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

The API is fully documented and available @ `https://localhost:8888/redoc`


Now you can use the web API endpoints which return JSON payloads:

```console
  $ curl -s http://localhost:8888/lights
  ...
  $ curl -s http://localhost:8888/light/0/on | jq
  {
    "light_id": 0,
    "action": "on",
    "color": "green"
  }
  $ curl -s http://localhost:8888/light/0/off | jq
  {
    "light_id": 0,
    "action": "off"
  }
  $ curl -s http://localhost:8888/light/0/on/purple | jq
  {
    "light_id": 0,
    "action": "on",
    "color": "purple"
  }
  $ curl -s http://localhost:8888/light/0/off | jq
  {
    "light_id": 0,
    "action": "off"
  }
  $ curl -s http://localhost:8888/lights/on | jq
  {
    "light_id": "all",
    "action": "on",
    "color": "green"
  }
  $ curl -s http://localhost:8888/lights/off | jq
  {
    "light_id": "all",
    "action": "off"
  }
  $ curl -s http://localhost:8888/lights/rainbow | jq
  {
    "light_id": "all",
    "action": "effect",
    "name": "rainbow"
  }
```

### Authentication
The API can be secured with a simple username and password through
[HTTP Basic Authentication][BASICAUTH]. To require authentication
for all API requests, set the `BUSYLIGHT_API_USER` and
`BUSYLIGHT_API_PASS` environmental variables before running
`busylight serve`.

> :warning: **SECURITY WARNING**: HTTP Basic Auth sends usernames and passwords in *cleartext* (i.e., unencrypted). Use of SSL is highly recommended!

## Code Examples

Adding light support to your own python applications is easy!

### Simple Case: Turn On a Single Light

In this example, we pick an Embrava Blynclight to activate with
the color white. 

```python
from busylight.lights.embrava import Blynclight

light = Blynclight.first_light()

light.on((255, 255, 255))
```

### Slightly More Complicated

The `busylight` package includes a manager class that's great for
working with multiple lights or lights that require a little
more direct intervention like the Kuando Busylight series.

```python
from busylight.manager import LightManager, ALL_LIGHTS
from busylight.effects import rainbow

manager = LightManager()
for light in manager.lights:
   print(light.name)

manager.apply_effect_to_light(ALL_LIGHTS, rainbow)
...
manager.lights_off(ALL_LIGHTS)
```
