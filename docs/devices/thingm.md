## ThingM blink(1)

ThingM is a California company thagt describes themselves as a "device
studio" and offer many different LED based devices; the consumer
oriented blink(1) product line and for prototyping and hacking they
offer the BlinkM line of products. I developed with the blink(1) mk3
device.

### Physical Description

#### blink(1)

The ThingM blink(1) is the smallest USB connected LED light I have
worked with so far. The device mostly consists of a USB-A male
connector with a wraparound transluscent diffusor. The device
dimensions are _roughly_ 1.5 inches long, (excluding USB-A male
connector), 1.25 inches wide and 0.25 inches deep.  The device has two
LEDs; one firing up and the other firing down. My ThingM blink(1) mk3
shipped with an approximately 3 foot long USB cable with a USB-A male
connector and a USB-A female connector.
