## Luxafor Flag 

The Luxafor line of products includes many devices which are designed
for office productivity. The Luxafor Flag is the only USB connected
presense light.

### Physical Description

The Luxafor Flag is small device with six LEDs and a female mini-USB
port. The main body of the device is rectangular; roughly 1.75 inches
long, 0.5 inches wide and 0.25 inches deep. The device's transluscent
defuser sticks out of "top" of the enclosure, roughly 1.25 inches
square and maybe an eighth of an inch in width. There are three
forward firing LEDs which light the flag and three rear firing LEDs
which are easily visible through the opaque enclosure. Lastly, there
is a relatively strong magnet embedded in the enclosure, near the USB
port, which can be used with the supplied adhesive-backed magnet to
"mount" the light.
