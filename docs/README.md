![BusyLight Project Logo][1]

The [BusyLight for Humansâ„¢][0] project provides a common interface to
several types of USB connected LED lights from multiple vendors:

- [Embrava][2] BlyncLight family of connected lights
- [Kuando][3] BusyLight UC Omega and UC Alpha
- [Luxafor][4] Flag
- [ThingM][5] blink(1)
- [Agile Innovations][6] BlinkStick

The general use case for most these products is integration with a
communication application via a plugin of some sort: Skype, Teams,
Jabber, and Zoom being common. Those plugins detect when a user is
busy communicating and changes the color of the light to signal they
are busy. The general capabilities of the presense lights tend to be
similar: turn on with a color, turn off, and blink on and off.

After that, the capabilities of lights begin to diverge. Several
lights can also play a tune from a selection stored in firmware. Some
lights are "write-only" and others provide introspection into the
current state of the device. Most devices can maintain their current
state without further software intervention, while some require
software intervention to operate.

The following is a technical review of each of the lights, their
capabilties, and difficulties encountered while adding support for
them. All of these devices are accessible via the USB Human Interface
Device (HID) application programming interface (API). This project
would not be possible without the hard work and generosity of these
two projects:

- [LibUSB HIDAPI][7]
- [TREZOR Cython HID API][8]
